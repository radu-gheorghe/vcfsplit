vcfsplit
===========

AutoIT3 app for splitting VCF (vCard) files containing multiple contacts

Usage
-----
- open the app :D
- give it the full path to your VCF file
- give it the full path of your destination directory
- wait for it to finish

In your destination directory you fill find a list of files called 1.vcf, 2.vcf and so on.

What for?
---------
Some phones (a Samsung Galaxy S, for instance) can import multiple contacts to a vCard file. The problem appears when you want to import that in something that can't see all the contacts from there. For example, Outlook 2007 or a Nokia E71.

With an E71 for example, you can use this app to split your big VCF into many small ones, copy them to your memory card under Others -> Contacts, then on your phone go to Contacts -> Copy -> From memory card. And you're done :)
